#  My first Chat Application using React, Firebase & ChatEngine that uses gmail authentication to let you into the app.
## Then you can create a new Chat Room
### Then You can also use the gmail of other people to add them to your room
### `Note: You can share the App URL with your friends, colleagues. Once they log in you can add them into your room to create a group and chat in group`
